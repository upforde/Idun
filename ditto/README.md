# Ditto: Deep Entity Matching with Pre-Trained Language Models

A fork of the original [Ditto Entity Matching System](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ditto) repository.

All credit goes to the original creators of the system. The fork is intended to use purely in an academic setting and in no way to profit off of it. 

The code has been changed slightly to suit the project better, but none of the changes are substantial. The changes are the way the model logs output, as well as some alterations to make the model easier to automate together with the slurm system.
