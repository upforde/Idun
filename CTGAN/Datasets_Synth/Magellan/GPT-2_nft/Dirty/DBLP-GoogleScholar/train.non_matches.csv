It's very good at supporting SQL with multi-factor authentication methods, but is more slow than Python3 which uses NTLM for authentication. 2. A single SQLite.dll is too small for a large relational database, so it must be configured with DDL, NTLM and one or more relational databases. But at minimum, no other programming languages do this. 3. No one would trust the memory management system, so they need to install N",0
