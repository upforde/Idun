# Magellan: Toward Building Entity Matching Management Systems

**NOTE:** 
This directory has later in development been rendered obsolete by the [[../CTGAN]](https://github.com/upforde/Idun/tree/main/CTGAN/) folder. We leave this directory in to show the Magellan pipeline workflow.

<details><summary>About this directory</summary>

This hierachy utilizes Jupyter notebooks found in [Notebooks](https://github.com/upforde/Idun/tree/main/magellan/Notebooks) folder. Each notebook goes over certain stages in our data testing framework. 

**These are:**
*1. CTGAN training pipeline.
2. CTGAN generation pipeline.
3. Magellan manual sampling with blockers.
4. Magellan development testing.*

The original py_entitymatching code repository with the projects homepage, user manual, and guides can be found [here](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/py_entitymatching)
